# safe_statistic
 
 This repository contains the detailed code for the work presented in [``A Stellar Activity F-statistic for Exoplanet Surveys (SAFE)" (Holzer et al. 2021)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/abf5e0?fbclid=IwAR3embrzwU_A2pT-_hmW9Fzix_x9pRkyHkvibvqp5t_7Q-HbiLJYTu85iZ0). The code here is primarily written in python. The same methodology is available in the R package **rvmethod 0.2.0** available on the CRAN or by downloading and installing the file "rvmethod.zip" here.
