# safe_statistic
 
 This repository contains the detailed code for the work presented in ``A Stellar Activity F-statistic for Exoplanet Surveys (SAFE)" (Holzer et al. 2021). The code here is primarily written in python. The same methodology is available in the R package **rvmethod 0.2.0** available on the CRAN or by downloading and installing the file "rvmethod.zip" here.
